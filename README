# This module allows for various client and server configurations of rsyslog
#
# Features:
#
# * UDP, TCP and RELP protocol support
# * outchannels and templates
# * IPTables support for servers (requires the iptables type)
# * Multiple servers can be deployed onto a node using various protocol/port specifications.
#
# 3 wrapper classes have been provided to support a sane 3-tier logging framework:
#
# rsyslog::bottom
#
# This class forwards all logs to $my_loghost over RELP.
#
# rsyslog::middle
#
# This class sets up a 3 servers 
#	- udp/514
#	- tcp/10514
#	- relp/20514
#
# The iptables rules are modified to accept appropriate traffic for each instance. 
# Logs are stored in /var/log/hosts/messages which is rotated to
# /var/log/hosts/messages.1 upon reaching 50mb. This class also sets up log forwarding
# of all logs to $my_loghost using the RELP protocol.
#
# rsyslog::top
#
# This class sets up a server which accepts RELP traffic on
# port 20514. The server's iptables rules are modified to accept
# appropriate TCP traffic and logs are stored in dynamically created
# directories under /var/log/hosts according to the client's hostname
# and the current date.
#
# If needed, more flexible servers and clients can be created by using
# the rsyslog::client and rsyslog::server definitions directly.
